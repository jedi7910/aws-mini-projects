# S3 Static Website Hosting with KMS Encryption

This project provides modular Bash scripts to create and manage a static website hosted on AWS S3, with optional file upload and KMS encryption support.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Overview

The main orchestrator script, `orchestrate_bucket.sh`, automates the entire workflow by invoking helper scripts for each step:

| Script                        | Purpose                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `create_bucket.sh`           | Creates an S3 bucket                                                    |
| `disable_block_public_access.sh` | Disables Block Public Access for the bucket                             |
| `configure_website.sh`       | Enables static website hosting on the bucket                           |
| `apply_public_read_policy.sh`| Applies a public read bucket policy                                     |
| `upload_files.sh`            | Uploads site files to the bucket (supports `.s3ignore`)                 |
| `validate_upload.sh`         | Lists files in the bucket to confirm a successful upload                |
| `delete_bucket.sh`           | Deletes the bucket and its contents                                    |

All logs are time-stamped and written to `logs/YYYY-MM-DD.log`.

### Arguments

| Argument      | Description                                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `action`      | One of: `create`, `configure`, `upload`, `validate`, `delete` |
| `BUCKET_NAME` | Globally unique name for your S3 bucket                       |
| `REGION`      | AWS region (e.g., `us-east-1`)                                |
| `PROFILE`     | AWS CLI profile name                                          |
| `FILE_PATH`   | (Optional) Directory to upload (used with `create`/`upload`)  |
| `KMS_ALIAS`   | (Optional) KMS key alias (e.g., `alias/my-storage-key`)       |
     |


## Examples
Create a new encrypted static website bucket and upload your site files:
```bash
./orchestrate_bucket.sh create my-test-bucket-kh1079 us-east-1 iamadmin-gen ./website_files alias/my-storage-key
```

Configure an existing bucket for static website hosting:
```bash
./orchestrate_bucket.sh configure my-test-bucket-kh1079 us-east-1 iamadmin-gen
```

Upload update files to your bucket:
```bash
./orchestrate_bucket.sh upload my-test-bucket-kh1079 us-east-1 iamadmin-gen ./website_files
```

Validate files are uploaded:
```bash
./orchestrate_bucket.sh validate my-test-bucket-kh1079 us-east-1 iamadmin-gen
```

Delete bucket and all its contents:
```bash
./orchestrate_bucket.sh delete my-test-bucket-kh1079 us-east-1 iamadmin-gen
```

## KMS Integration Details
- The create action ensures a KMS Customer Master Key (CMK) exists with the provided alias (e.g., alias/my-storage-key)
- Bucket encryption is configured to use this KMS key for server-side encryption (SSE-KMS)
- All uploaded objects will be encrypted by default using the KMS key
- Ensure your IAM profile has permissions for KMS actions on the key alias

## Notes on KMS Encryption

## Validation and Verification
After uploading your files, validate the upload and confirm your static website is accessible.

### Step 1: Validate Uploaded Files
Run:
```bash
./orchestrate_bucket.sh validate my-test-bucket-kh1079 us-east-1 iamadmin-gen
```
This lists bucket contents so you can verify your website files (index.html, error.html, CSS, JS, images, etc.) are present.

### Step 2: Verify Website Acessiblity
- Open the AWS S3 console
- Navigate to your bucket
- Go to the Properties tab > Static website hosting
- Use the displayed Endpoint URL to open your website in a browser

Example URL format:
```bash
http://my-test-bucket-kh1079.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```
If you see your homepage load, deployment was successful.

## Notes on Public Access and KMS Encryption
- You can pass an optional KMS alias when running create
- If the alias doesn't exist, the script will create a new KMS key with the provided alias
- Buckets are configured to use SSE-KMS for all objects
- Public static website hosting is not compatible with encrypted objects (youâ€™ll get InvalidRequest errors when accessing the files via HTTP)
- Use KMS only if your site is not meant to be accessed publicly, or for testing

## .s3ignore Support
You can exclude unwanted files from upload by creating a .s3ignore file in your upload directory:
```text
.DS_Store
*.tmp
*.bak
Thumbs.db
ehthumbs.db
Desktop.ini
```
The upload script automatically excludes files matching these patterns

## Logging
The scripts include basic logging support (lib/logging.sh) and output logs to the logs/ directory with timestamps for audit and troubleshooting.
